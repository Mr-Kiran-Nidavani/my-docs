It involves crafting inputs that guide the model to produce desired outputs, improving accuracy, relevance, and usefulness. Types of Prompts 1. Instructional Prompts Direct the model to perform a specific task. Summarize the following article in three sentences. 2. Completion Prompts Provide a partial input and ask the model to complete it. Once upon a time, in a distant land, 3. Question-Answer Prompts Pose a question for the model to answer. What are the benefits of renewable energy? 4. Few-Shot Prompts Include examples to guide the model's response. Translate English to French: - Hello \u2192 Bonjour - Thank you \u2192 Merci - Good night \u2192 5. Zero-Shot Prompts Ask the model to perform a task without examples. Classify the sentiment of this review: \"The product exceeded my expectations.\" 6. Chain-of-Thought Prompts Encourage the model to explain its reasoning step by step. If there are 3 apples and you take away 2, how many are left? Let's think step by step. Prompt Formats Plain Text: Simple instructions or questions. Markdown: Structured formatting for clarity. Code Blocks: For programming-related tasks. Lists and Tables: Organize information for better comprehension. Best Practices Be clear and specific. Provide context when necessary. Use examples for complex tasks. Iterate and refine prompts based on output quality.
