# Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to effectively interact with AI language models. It involves crafting inputs that guide the model to produce desired outputs, improving accuracy, relevance, and usefulness.

## Types of Prompts

### 1. Instructional Prompts
Direct the model to perform a specific task.
```markdown
Summarize the following article in three sentences.
```

### 2. Completion Prompts
Provide a partial input and ask the model to complete it.
```markdown
Once upon a time, in a distant land,
```

### 3. Question-Answer Prompts
Pose a question for the model to answer.
```markdown
What are the benefits of renewable energy?
```

### 4. Few-Shot Prompts
Include examples to guide the model's response.
```markdown
Translate English to French:
- Hello → Bonjour
- Thank you → Merci
- Good night →
```

### 5. Zero-Shot Prompts
Ask the model to perform a task without examples.
```markdown
Classify the sentiment of this review: "The product exceeded my expectations."
```

### 6. Chain-of-Thought Prompts
Encourage the model to explain its reasoning step by step.
```markdown
If there are 3 apples and you take away 2, how many are left? Let's think step by step.
```

## Prompt Formats

- **Plain Text:** Simple instructions or questions.
- **Markdown:** Structured formatting for clarity.
- **Code Blocks:** For programming-related tasks.
- **Lists and Tables:** Organize information for better comprehension.

## Best Practices

- Be clear and specific.
- Provide context when necessary.
- Use examples for complex tasks.
- Iterate and refine prompts based on output quality.
